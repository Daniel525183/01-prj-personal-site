    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Daniel Palomino Gomez, and I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Illinois, Chicago. 
      I am both a part of the College of Engineering as well as the Honors College, and I am additionally a part of the prestigious Presidential Award Honors Program.<br><br>
      During High School, I was a high caliber student who maintained a 4.0 GPA while being actively involved in my school's FIRST Robotics Team: Team #2151, The Monty Pythons!<br>
      The time I spent during those four years of robotics (first as a regular member, and later on as the Programming Captain) further grew my interest in Computer Science, which is why I feel that I am firmly committed to my major.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>HTML</li>

    <div class="skill-details">
      <p><strong>Python:</strong> I just recently learned Python from my CS 111 Class!</p>
      <p><strong>Java:</strong> I started learning Java during my first year of high school. It was the language my robotics team used during the entire time I was a member, so I consider myself somewhat competent at it. Of course, I still have much to learn, and I'm looking forward to doing so!</p>
      <p><strong>C++:</strong> I am currently learning C++ in my CS 151 class. So far, it's been extremely similar to Java, so I have had an easy time learning it.</p>
      <p><strong>HTML:</strong> Currently learning HTML from this program -- I'll try my best to learn it rather than just copy from the AI tools.</p>
      <p><strong>CSS:</strong> Same case here!</p>
      <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> I did learn a bit of JavaScript during my sophomore year (Thanks AP Computer Science Principles!), but I am definitely looking forward to the refresher that this course will be.</p>
